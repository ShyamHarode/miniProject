                The HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. You can make your own website using HTML. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It can be assisted
                by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript to describe a web page's presentation or appearence and fumctionality.

                <pre>The term "hypertext" refers to links that connect online pages inside a single website or between websites.
                     Links are an important part of the Internet. HTML annotates text, pictures, and other content for display in a Web browser using "markup." Tags, which are written in angle brackets, separate HTML elements.</pre>

                                            Title
                    
                        The <title> tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

                        The <title> tag is required in HTML documents!

                        The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

                        The <title> element:

                        Defines a title in the browser toolbar.
                        Provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites.
                        Displays a title for the page in search-engine results.
                        Here are some tips for creating good titles:

                        Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles)
                        Search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that
                        Do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results)
                        So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

                        Example:
                        <!DOCTYPE html>
                        <html>
                            <head>
                                <title>HTML Elements Reference</title>
                            </head>
                            
                            <body>
                                <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                                <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                            </body>
                        </html>

                        Body
                      
                        The <body> tag defines the document's body.

                        The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

                        Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document

                        Div & Span
                        
                        HTML <div> and <span> Tags

                        Both <div> and <span> is used to define parts of a web page. The <span> element shows the inline portion of a document. The <div> elements show a block-level portion of a document.
                        A div is a block-level element and a span is an inline element.
                        The div should be used to wrap sections of a document, while use spans to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.

                    HTML Accessibility
Always write HTML code with accessibility in mind!

Provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML code as semantic as possible.

Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning.
Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud.

With the button example in mind:

buttons have more suitable styling by default
a screen reader identifies it as a button
focusable
clickable
A button is also accessible for people relying on keyboard-only navigation; it can be clickable with both mouse and keys, and it can be tabbed between (using the tab key on the keyboard).

Alternative Text
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

The language that we use to style an HTML document is CSS.

CSS specifies how HTML elements should appear. CSS specifies how elements should appear on a screen, on paper, in speech, or in other forms of media.

                CSS Selectors
A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

                Styling in CSS
There are 3 distinct methods for styling in CSS, Local style, Page-Level style, and External Styles. Each level of styling is given a different hierarchical priority (when to apply) and is used for different reasons.

The 3 methods are further grouped into two categories. Namely Internal CSS and External CSS. Internal CSS is comprised of Local Styles and Page-Level Styles while External CSS is just as the name implies.

                <pre>   Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications.
                     It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.
                     It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue.
                      Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens 
                      ( Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). 
                      All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project. </pre>
